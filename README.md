# Counter-Strike 2 Landing Page

A simple, good-looking website for Counter-Strike 2 that anyone can use and customize.

## What is this?

I created this landing page because I love CS2 and wanted to practice making websites. It's designed to be super simple - no complicated frameworks or build tools needed. Just open the HTML file and it works!

## Why I made it simple

After seeing tons of overly complex websites with crazy animations and effects, I wanted to go back to basics. This site focuses on:
- Clean, readable design
- Fast loading times
- Easy to understand code
- Works on phones, tablets, and computers

## How to use it

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Double-click on index.html 
3. That's it! Your browser will open the website

No installing anything, no command line stuff, no headaches.

## What I used to build it

- Regular HTML (no fancy stuff)
- CSS for styling (with some nice hover effects)
- A tiny bit of JavaScript for smooth scrolling
- Real CS2 images from Steam

## Does it work on phones?

Yep! I made sure it looks good on everything - big screens, laptops, tablets, and phones.

## Future ideas

Maybe I'll add:
- A contact form
- News section
- Player stats
- Tournament info
- Dark/light mode toggle

But for now, I'm keeping it simple and focused.
